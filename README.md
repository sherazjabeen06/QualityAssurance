Tools and Frameworks

Selenium: A powerful tool for automating web browsers, facilitating automated testing for finding bugs.
Project Framework: Participants can use their preferred testing frameworks, such as BDD, DDTF, KDTF, Hybrid, etc., to enhance code maintainability and readability. 
Programming Language: Use Python or Java for scripting automation tests, showcasing proficiency in the programming language.
Testing Framework: Pytest or TestNG framework for advanced testing capabilities and reporting features.
Testing Scope: Ensure user-friendliness, functionality across devices, operating systems, browsers, and consistent behavior on various screen sizes.
Compatibility: Validate responsiveness and functionality across different environments to ensure consistent performance.
Packages/Dependencies: pip for Python or Maven Dependencies enables participants to manage dependencies and project configurations efficiently.
Reporting: Use pytest-html reports for Python or Extent reports/Allure reports for Java.
GitHub & Jenkins Integration: Participants are required to push their code to GitHub and integrate the Selenium project with Jenkins for automated testing.
Project Structure: Complete project submission should adhere to appropriate folder structure standards on GitHub with proper Readme.md, avoiding single code file submissions.
Attachments: Submissions must include screenshots and short videos demonstrating the project's execution for spotting the bugs, along with providing the GitHub URL and video URL in a Google Form.

Deliverables

Test Scenario,Testcase Template, Requirement Traceability matrix (RTM) to be submitted. 
Participants are expected to submit a detailed bug report in an Excel spreadsheet, outlining each bug with descriptions, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and severity within the stipulated time frame. 
Evaluation will be based on criteria such as number of bugs spotted, efficiency, code quality, and adherence to the testing framework.
